1- Open the index.html file. You will notice that it looks the same as the final product for our last exercise.
2- For this exercise we will learn how to use a library called bootstrap, which was created by twitter to style websites.
   To use bootstrap we need to link our website to three dependencies (files needed for bootstrap to function). These files are
   jquery-3.3.1.min.js bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js.
3- Link the website to the bootstrap.css file.
    * Right below the title in the head of our website lets add the link by typing 'link:css' and pressing enter.
    * Change the value of the href attribute from 'style.css' to 'bootstrap.css'
4- Link the website to the bootstrap.js file
    * At the very end of the body of the website in line 26 type 'script:src' and press enter.
    * In the src attribute of the script type 'bootstrap.js'
5- Link the website to the jquery-3.3.1.min.js file
    * At the very end of the body of the website in line 26 type 'script:src' and press enter.
    * In the src attribute of the script type 'jquery-3.3.1.min.js'
6- We are now ready to start using bootstrap in our website. Let's add a division right below  the heading for each of our 
    current divisions.
    * Click at the end of each heading, press enter to create a new line below it, type div and press enter to add a division.
    * For each new division add a class named 'row'.
7- Let's add three columns inside each row.
    * Create three divisions inside each of the divisions you just created.
    * Add a class to each of these new divisions and name it col-4
        Example: class="col-4"
7- Inside of each of our new columns let's an image.
    * To add an image simply type 'img' and press enter. Then set the 'src' attribute to the location of the image.
    * These images can be found inside of the 'images' folder.
        * To go inside of a folder, you need to type the folder name followed by '/'.
        * Make sure that you add the images to their corresponding sections (Don't add a computer to the chairs division)
8- As you can see the images are way too big. Let's fix it:
    * Open the style.css file to change the height of the images.
    * Since we want to change the height of all images, we can just make the changes to all the 'img' elements in our website.
      When we make changes to an element we don't have to type anything in front of the name like we have to do for classes and 
      id's.
    * Inside of the css file simply type 'img' and open and close curly braces {}
    * Inside of the curly braces set the width to 100% (This means that the image's width will fill the assigned area; no more
        and no less)
9- Go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/#background-color to learn about background colors with bootstrap.
10- Add a background color to each of the headings.
11- Preview the changes.
